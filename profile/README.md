# ðŸ”­ Goals

1. ðŸ«µ Prioritizing **YOU**
   
   YouTube+ is a Google Chrome Extension that focuses on user customization of YouTube. All features gear towards letting people make it look and work on their terms. If you look at YouTube today, it's drained and flatted to a grey slate of videos; YouTube+ brings you features to make this tailored to you and also features to save you time.


2. ðŸ“ˆ Straight to the **point**

    People don't like things in their way; this extension allows you to search for what you need and change it. Nothing will ever be in your way, like subscriptions and donations. YouTube+ will never ask for or need payment to access a feature.

3. ðŸ”§ You can **change YouTube+**

    Nathan Parker (KingPr0o7) single-handedly created YouTube+ and is only one person. YouTube+ is open-source, allowing you to fix/change whatever you want! You can also contribute by requesting a pull request permitting you to join the history of refinement of YouTube+. You can do various things when contributing; a big one is translations; my dream is YouTube+ can one day be accessible to as many people around the globe. I can only do so much, although, with teamwork, we can reach the stars!
